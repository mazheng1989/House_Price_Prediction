# House_Price_Prediction
In this project, I will try to predict a state's median housing listing price based on time series data and other factors. Predictors may include: median housing prices in the previous 12 months, active listing count in the previous 12 months, other housing factors, as well as the SPY 500 index to reflect the performance of the general economy. I will apply time series analysis and regression models to build a housing price prediction model for each US state. In some exploratory analysis, I found that while the housing price in some states has a significant seasonal pattern (e.g. plot1, California), the housing price in other states are less affected by seasons (e.g. plot2, Florida). Meanwhile, they both seem to have a close relationship to the stock market, thought the specific pattern might be different. The expected outcome of this project is to provide an accurate housing price prediction tailored for each individual state. I will also try to discuss why certain factor is important to predict housing price in some states, but not the others.
